# TimeLink

## About

Our first team project as full stack students. This is our teams very first browser game built with React and Node. We are proud to present our **Time Link**. Liitle Alien Bob travels through the earth's history and ends up at his spaceship in the time when he came to visit and travels home.
The Player has to answer questions to proceed on the gameplay field.
Our team:
Vladimir Beliakov, Balaeat Hossain, Saara Rikama and Stefanie Jana.

## This is a repository of our planning phase

We used this repository first and then our brave Balaeat cleaned up the file structure and we moved to this repository (you can find the link below).
This repo contains most of our planning and ideas, and also the first prototype of the game.
