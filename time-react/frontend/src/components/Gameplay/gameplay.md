1. Gameplay.jsx:

   Role: This is the main game board, displaying the grid and other UI elements such as items and user info.
   Content: It contains the layout for the grid and serves as the background for the gameplay.
   Grid: The grid fields (p1, p2, ..., p20) are used to define where the figure can move.

2. AlienImg.jsx (or your Game.jsx in earlier examples):

   Role: This component controls the player's movements on the grid, triggering the riddles and updating the figure's position.
   Content: The position state and path array define where the figure should move. The Riddle component is used to display a riddle when the player reaches a new position on the grid.
   Integration: It listens for the riddle’s solution (via handleRiddleSolved), and when solved, it moves the figure to the next position in the path.

3. Riddle.jsx:

   Role: Displays a riddle and waits for the player to submit an answer.
   Content: It generates random riddles from a list and checks if the player's answer is correct. If correct, it triggers the next step (moving the figure).
   Integration: The onSolve function passed as a prop from AlienImg.jsx is called when the riddle is solved.

How they fit together:

    Gameplay.jsx provides the visual grid and UI.
        The player’s movements (on the grid) and riddles will be handled by AlienImg.jsx (or your Game component).
        AlienImg.jsx will render the figure’s current position (based on the position state), and each time the player moves to the next grid spot, a riddle from Riddle.jsx will be shown.

    The Player’s Progress:
        AlienImg.jsx triggers a riddle when the player reaches a new grid spot, and if the answer is correct, it moves the player to the next position.
        This happens in a loop until the player has completed all the steps in the predefined path.
