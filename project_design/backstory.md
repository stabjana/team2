# Backstory

Bob the little alien came from far far away to visit our planet, because it seemed to be interesting. When he was looking for some other beings in the universe he saw our sun and the earth as small points in the telescope and maybe there is something like satellites moving around the earth. There must be intelligent lifeforms there.  
So he dacided to travel there to see who is there.  
As he was passing a quantum singularity, he moved on and when he reached the earth he recognized he must be still inside the singularity, because he landed in the very early eras of earths past.  
After some calculations he found out that he has to move through the time to get back home in the end.

An **eon** is the largest geochronologic time unit and is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic eonothem.[13] There are four formally defined eons: the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic.[2]
An **era** is the second largest geochronologic time unit and is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic erathem.[14][13] There are ten defined eras: the Eoarchean, Paleoarchean, Mesoarchean, Neoarchean, Paleoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, with none from the Hadean eon.[2]
A **period** is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic system.[14][13] There are 22 defined periods, with the current being the Quaternary period.[2] As an exception two subperiods are used for the Carboniferous Period.[14]
An **epoch** is the second smallest geochronologic unit. It is equivalent to a chronostratigraphic series.[14][13] There are 37 defined epochs and one informal one. **The current epoch is the Holocene**. There are also 11 subepochs which are all within the Neogene and Quaternary.[2] The use of subepochs as formal units in international chronostratigraphy was ratified in 2022.[15]

### 1st era Archean Eon

The processes that gave rise to life on Earth are not completely understood, but there is substantial evidence that life came into existence either near the end of the Hadean Eon or early in the Archean Eon.
The earliest identifiable fossils consist of stromatolites, which are microbial mats formed in shallow water by cyanobacteria.

### 2nd era Proterozoic

It covers the time from the appearance of free oxygen in Earth's atmosphere to just before the proliferation of complex life on the Earth during the Cambrian Explosion.
emergence of advanced single-celled eukaryotes
By the late Palaeoproterozoic, eukaryotic organisms had become moderately biodiverse.
The earliest fossils possessing features typical of fungi date to the Paleoproterozoic Era

### 3rd era Paleozoic (subera of Phanerozoic)

Phanerozoic:
he first fossils of animals, including trilobites and archeocyathids, as well as the animal-like Caveasphaera, appear.

Divided into three eras: the **Paleozoic, Mesozoic** and Cenozoic, which are further subdivided into 12 periods.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic

The Paleozoic is a time in Earth's history when active complex life forms evolved, took their first foothold on dry land, and when the forerunners of all multicellular life on Earth began to diversify. There are six periods in the Paleozoic era: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian.[10]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleozoic

### 4th era Mesozoic

**Dinosaurs** first appeared in the Mid-Triassic, and became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates in the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic, occupying this position for about 150 or 135 million years until their demise at the end of the Cretaceous. Archaic birds appeared in the Jurassic, having evolved from a branch of theropod dinosaurs, then true toothless birds appeared in the Cretaceous. The first mammals also appeared during the Mesozoic, but would remain small—less than 15 kg (33 lb)—until the Cenozoic. Flowering plants appeared in the Early Cretaceous and would rapidly diversify through the end of the era, replacing conifers and other gymnosperms (sensu lato), like ginkgoales, cycads and bennettitales as the dominant group of plants.

**Congratulations! You just killed all dinosaurs**

### 5th era Cenozoic

The Cenozoic is Earth's current geological era, representing the last 66 million years of Earth's history. It is characterized by the dominance of mammals, birds, conifers, and angiosperms (flowering plants). It is the latest of three geological eras of the Phanerozoic Eon, preceded by the Mesozoic and Paleozoic.

### Paleolithic

The Paleolithic or Palaeolithic, also called the Old Stone Age, is a period in human prehistory that is distinguished by the original development of stone tools, and which represents almost the entire period of human prehistoric technology.

### Mesolithic

Middle Stone Age
It becomes warmer and in many regions the ice that covered large areas of the northern hemisphere.
Large mammals extinct because the dramatic change of climate as well as the change of food sources due to that.

The Mesolithic has different time spans in different parts of Eurasia. It refers to the final period of hunter-gatherer cultures in Europe and the Middle East, between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the Neolithic Revolution. In Europe it spans roughly 15,000 to 5,000 BP; in the Middle East (the Epipalaeolithic Near East) roughly 20,000 to 10,000 BP. The term is less used of areas farther east, and not at all beyond Eurasia and North Africa.

The type of culture associated with the Mesolithic varies between areas, but it is associated with a decline in the group hunting of large animals in favour of a broader hunter-gatherer way of life, and the development of more sophisticated and typically smaller lithic tools and weapons than the heavy-chipped equivalents typical of the Paleolithic.

An ancient chewed gum made from the pitch of birch bark revealed that a woman enjoyed a meal of hazelnuts and duck about 5,700 years ago in southern Denmark.

### Neolithic

The Neolithic or New Stone Age is an archaeological period, the final division of the Stone Age in Europe, Asia, Mesopotamia and Africa (c. 10,000 BC to c. 2,000 BC).  
It saw the Neolithic Revolution, a wide-ranging set of developments that appear to have arisen independently in several parts of the world. This "Neolithic package" included the introduction of farming, domestication of animals, and change from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one of settlement.

### Bronze Age

The Bronze Age (c. 3300 – c. 1200 BC) was a historical period characterised principally by the use of bronze tools and the development of complex urban societies, as well as the adoption of writing in some areas.

An ancient civilisation is deemed to be part of the Bronze Age if it either produced bronze by smelting its own copper and alloying it with tin, arsenic, or other metals, or traded other items for bronze from producing areas elsewhere. Bronze Age cultures were the first to develop writing. According to archaeological evidence, cultures in Mesopotamia, which used cuneiform script, and Egypt, which used hieroglyphs, developed the earliest practical writing systems.

West Asia and the Near East were the first regions to enter the Bronze Age, beginning with the rise of the Mesopotamian civilisation of **Sumer** in the mid-4th millennium BC. Cultures in the ancient Near East practised intensive year-round agriculture; developed writing systems; invented the potter's wheel, created centralised governments (usually in the form of hereditary monarchies), formulated written law codes, developed city-states, nation-states and empires; embarked on advanced architectural projects; and introduced social stratification, economic and civil administration, slavery, and practised organised warfare, medicine, and religion. Societies in the region laid the foundations for astronomy, mathematics, and astrology.

### Iron Age

The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three historical Metal Ages. It has also been considered as the final age of protohistory (before written history).

Although meteoric iron has been used for millennia in many regions, the beginning of the Iron Age is defined locally around the world by archaeological convention when the production of smelted iron (especially steel tools and weapons) replaces their bronze equivalents in common use.

In Anatolia and the Caucasus, or Southeast Europe, the Iron Age began during the late 2nd millennium BC (c. 1300 BC).[3] In the Ancient Near East, this transition occurred simultaneously with the Late Bronze Age collapse, during the 12th century BC (1200–1100 BC). The technology soon spread throughout the Mediterranean Basin region and to South Asia between the 12th and 11th century BC. Its further spread to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central Europe was somewhat delayed, and Northern Europe was not reached until about the start of the 5th century BC (500 BC).

The Iron Age in India is stated as beginning with the ironworking Painted Grey Ware culture, dating from the 15th century BC, through to the reign of Ashoka in the 3rd century BC.  
In China, written history started before iron smelting began, so the term is used infrequently for the archaeology of China.

### Roman period/

The Roman Empire ruled the Mediterranean and much of Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. The Romans conquered most of this during the Republic, and it was ruled by emperors following Octavian's assumption of effective sole rule in 27 BC. The western empire collapsed in 476 AD, but the eastern empire lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire

The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire centred in Constantinople during late antiquity and the Middle Ages.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire

he political history of the western Roman empire was brought to a dramatic end in the fifth century, by the successful invasions of a number of Germanic peoples (Goths, Vandals, Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and others). These peoples set up their own states, ruled by their own kings.
