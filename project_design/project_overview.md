## 4. Main milestones (decomposit later)

- Milestone 1: Completion of planning and design (Week 2);
- Milestone 2: Draft of the frontend (overlay, user interface) and backend (DB, login, server) completed (Week 3);
- Milestone 3: The point of no return. All features are documented. No major changes to the project are allowed beyond this point (Week 4);
- Milestone 4: Frontend and backend basic functionality completed (Week 6);
- Milestone 5: Art design is consistent. The page looks fine (Week 7);
- Milestone 6: Final testing and feedback implemented (Week 8);
- Milestone 7: Final deployment and documentation (Week 9).

1. Frontend Developer(s): Responsible for building the UI, components, and user interactions.
2. Backend Developer(s): Responsible for setting up the server, database, and API endpoints.
3. Art Designer(s): Optional role. It's not a commercial project; it can look like "well... it works."
